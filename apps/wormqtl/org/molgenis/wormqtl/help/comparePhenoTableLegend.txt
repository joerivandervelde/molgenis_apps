ComparePheno Table Tutorial

- Vs. phenotype
This is the phenotype for which this row is reporting. Your selected phenotype(s)
showed overlap (in any degree) with this Vs. phenotype

- From source
The source from which the Vs. phenotype is from. 

- Genes overlap
x Vs. y -> x is the number of genes with an ortholog for your selected phenotype(s).
y is the number of genes with an ortholog for this Vs. phenotype

- Overlap details
Shows which genes are associated with the selected phenotype(s) 
and the Vs. phenotype. It also shows which genes are overlapping. View of genes 
is capped at max 25.

- P-value
This value indicates whether the gene overlap is significant or not based on a 
hypergeometric test.

- Single test threshold
The p-value threshold for when only one test would be performed

- Bonferroni threshold
The p-value threshold after multiple testing correction. 

- Single test significant
Says if the p-value is significant for single test threshold

- Bonferroni significant
Says if the p-value is significant after multiple testing correction
